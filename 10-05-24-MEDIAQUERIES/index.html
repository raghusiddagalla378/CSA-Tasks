    <div class="media">
        <h1 id="head1">Introduction</h1>
        <p>With the help of media in CSS, we can use media queries to apply different styles for different devices. With the help of a media query, we can also check the device's height, width, resolution, and orientation (Portrait/Landscape).
            The main aim of the CSS rule is to make the webpage more responsive to deliver the optimized design for the different screen sizes. With the help of media queries, we can also specify the style for the screen readers.
        </p>

    <div>
        <div id="query">
        <h2>keywords</h2>
        <p>Below are some keywords that will be used while writing the media queries. These are as follows.</p>
        <p>Not: With the help of this keyword, we can revert the entire media query.</p>
        <p>Only: With the help of this keyword, we can prevent the old browser from applying the style property.</p>
        <p>And: With the help of this keyword, we can combine two media features and media queries.</p>
            
            
        <h3>Media Types</h3>
        <p>There are different types of media available in the media query. These are as follows.

                All: It is the default value for the media type. We can use this for all types of devices.
                Print: We can use this for printer devices.
                Screen: We can use this for the mobile or computer screen type, etc.
                Speech: We can use this for the screen reader, which is used to read the screen.
